description: "Take a prepared task and run it to 'ready for human review' on your own: code, self-review loop, self-fixes, verification, commits by the team convention, and an honest handover report. Use when the developer hands over a task whose analysis and grilling are already done — trigger on «реализуй задачу», «запускай в работу», «пили», «делай задачу», «бери таску», implement the task, run this task, even when the skill is never named and even right after a grill session ends. NOT for a small change the developer is watching — that is quick-edit. Does not analyse or grill the task, does not estimate it, and does not create the merge request."
compatibility: "Needs git. Written for Claude Code: it invokes the built-in code-review, security-review, simplify and run skills through the Skill tool, and degrades with a note in the handover when they are absent."

# Implement a task

## Role and boundaries

You finish the code; the developer owns the ideas. The task statement, the pre-analysis
and the grilling results are the developer's work and they are already done before this
skill starts. Downstream, the merge request is created by a separate tool.

**In scope:** writing the code, reviewing it yourself, fixing what the review finds,
verifying the result (tests always; live stand when the developer asked for it),
committing by the team convention, and handing over a report for human eyes.

**Out of scope — never do these:** analyzing or re-interpreting the task, grilling,
estimating, creating the MR, changing the task statement, improving adjacent code the
task does not touch. Surgical changes only.

**If the prepared context is missing — say so and stop.** Prepared context means: a
task statement that says what to do, what the expected result is, and how to verify
it (in any form, including the developer's own rewritten one), plus the analysis
results (and the grilling output, when the task was grilled). If any of that is
absent from the session and from the files the developer points to, stop. Do not
reconstruct the task yourself: that is the developer's step, not yours.

## Step 0 — Intake (one message, once)

Ask everything up front in a single message, then do not ask again until the handover.
The verify.md exchange below — the developer picking an option and you asking for the
blanks you could not fill — counts as part of intake; the stop rules below are the
only other exception:

1. **Live-stand verification: yes or no?** A plain "no" means option 3 below.
   If the project has `.claude/verify.md`, skim it against the repo right here at
   intake — do the commands, paths and ports it names exist? — and raise any
   mismatch now, before a line of code is written; on "yes" you will follow it. If the file is missing, include in this same
   intake message, under "if yes": the template from [verify-template.md](references/verify-template.md)
   pre-filled with what you found in the repo yourself, and its three options to
   choose from. Do not make the developer invent the format. After the developer
   chooses option 1 or 2, you write the `.claude/verify.md` file yourself and ask
   only for the blanks you can neither discover in the repo nor create yourself —
   Step 4 does not start while those are missing. Choosing option 3 cancels live
   verification for this run: Step 4 runs tests only, and the handover says live
   verification was skipped by choice.
2. **Anything genuinely ambiguous in the prepared materials** — ask now, not mid-flow.
   Only questions the analysis and grill did not already answer.

   **Resolve before you ask.** A question the project already answers is not the
   developer's to answer: go and read. Its `CLAUDE.md`, the code around the change, the
   standards from Step 1 and the conventions visible in the history settle most of what
   feels ambiguous at first reading. Say in the intake message what you closed this way
   and on what basis — one line each — so the developer can overrule a reading you got
   wrong. What survives is the genuine article: a product decision, a priority, access
   to something real, a trade-off with no right answer in the repository. Ask that, and
   only that.

When the prepared materials already answer the intake questions, still compose the
intake message for the record, map each pre-given answer onto the intake's own
options explicitly (stating the mapping in the recorded message), apply them, and
proceed without waiting.

## Step 1 — Standards

Find the team's standard for the stack this task touches, by the lookup in
[standards.md](references/standards.md): the project's own first, then the
developer's, then a knowledge base over MCP if one is configured, then the fallback
that ships with the skill. Read what applies; never paste whole documents into context.

Say in one line which source answered, and repeat that line in the handover — a reader
judging the result needs to know which bar it was measured against.

**Nothing found is not a stop.** Follow the conventions visible in the codebase and
record "no standard found" in the handover.

**When a standard conflicts with the prepared task statement** (say, a naming rule
against a name the task fixes), the statement wins — you never change the statement —
and the conflict is logged in the handover for the developer to settle.

## Step 2 — Code

- Surgical changes: touch only what the task requires. One exception: a pre-existing
  defect that blocks the task's own verification command (a broken test bootstrap,
  a build script that never worked) may be fixed — as a separate commit, named in
  the handover with proof it was broken before your change.
- Follow the minimal-code ladder before writing anything: does it need to exist
  at all → is it already in the codebase → is it in the stdlib → is it a native
  platform/framework feature → is it in an installed dependency → can it be one
  line → only then write minimal new code.
- If the `ponytail` plugin is installed, invoke its `ponytail` skill (Skill tool)
  now, before the first line of code — implementation is the only activity where
  it belongs, so its session-wide default is expected to be off (`/ponytail
  default off`). If it is not installed, apply the ladder yourself; the result
  must not differ.
- The ladder never overrides the task: when the statement explicitly asks for
  duplication or the "full" version of something, build exactly that and do not
  re-argue it — log the tension in the handover instead.
- Reuse existing solutions from the codebase; keep abstractions at the level the
  codebase already uses.
- Comments in English, explain "why" not "what"; unfinished edges marked `TODO:`.
- Write the tests the change needs, in the project's existing test style. If that
  style depends on generated artifacts (fixtures, snapshots) that cannot be generated
  in this environment, write them by hand and name them in the handover as the first
  thing a human must re-generate and verify.
- **When the task carries a Figma mockup** (a figma.com link, or a statement saying the
  work is by the mockup): invoke the `figma-design-to-code` skill on top of the official
  Figma MCP — `get_design_context` for structure and tokens, `get_screenshot` for the
  reference. The mockup is the source of truth for visuals, and the result is compared
  against the screenshot rather than against memory. Visual deviations are defects.
- **Once it compiles and the tests pass, run the built-in `simplify` skill** over the
  change. It only touches the diff, so the surgical rule holds. Review what it does as
  you would your own edit, and drop anything that contradicts the standard from Step 1.

## Step 3 — Self-review loop

One cycle = one review pass plus the fixes it caused; a pass closes only when the
reviewer's complete output is in, so findings arriving in batches from one pass are
one cycle. A review pass with zero findings ends the loop — no second cycle needed.
**Hard limit: two cycles.** If the
second cycle still leaves findings, stop and report them honestly in the handover —
do not spin a third time.

**Reviewers:**

1. **Built-in `code-review` skill** — always. Effort `medium` by default; **always
   `high` when the diff touches auth, permissions, money/billing, or personal data**
   ("money" means any code computing amounts a customer pays or is owed).
   Never rely on the sticky last-used level — pass the level explicitly every time.
   When the work lives outside the session's cwd (a worktree, another checkout), pass
   the path or branch explicitly and verify from the reviewer's own output that it
   reviewed the intended repo before accepting anything. If the built-in skill is
   unavailable, cannot target the diff (it reviewed a different repo or the session
   cwd instead), or its report has not come back to your context by the time the
   cycle is otherwise ready to close — do not sit waiting for it — review the diff
   yourself against [review-checklist.md](references/review-checklist.md) at the level this rule
   prescribes for the diff, and flag "built-in reviewer unavailable" in the
   handover. This manual pass takes the built-in reviewer's slot in the comparison
   below; a report that arrives after the slot was filled counts as confirmation
   (or extra findings for the current cycle), never as a new cycle.
2. **`ocr` (open-code-review) in delegation mode** — optional, only when the CLI is
   installed (`command -v ocr`). Delegation needs no LLM key: run
   `ocr delegate preview` to get its file selection for the change, then
   `ocr delegate rule <files>` — passing the file paths preview listed, one
   argument per file, without its markers or diff stats — for the resolved review
   rules, and apply those rules to the same diff as a second review pass yourself.
   Follow the rules' own precision guidance; absent one, use the level rule 1
   prescribes for this diff. All of it
   silently — no questions to the developer. If `ocr` is absent or errors, continue
   on the built-in reviewer alone — never interrupt the run over it; the handover's
   "which reviewers ran" line covers the fact, no complaint needed.

The categories in [review-checklist.md](references/review-checklist.md) are the review criteria on every
path — for the built-in skill's findings, for `ocr`'s, and for your own review pass.

Merge the findings from both before fixing. Every finding passes the standards filter
first: anything that contradicts the standard from Step 1 or the task's stated
scope is dropped, not applied. Findings outside the reviewed diff are dropped too —
and a reviewer whose findings are all outside the diff has not actually reviewed it;
treat it as unavailable. A finding that sits on a line of your diff but whose fix
would change the behavior of code paths the task does not touch counts as out of
scope as well: escalate it in the handover, do not apply it.

When both reviewers ran, keep the raw counts for the handover comparison section:
findings per reviewer, overlap, and what only one of them caught. Count only
findings that survive the standards filter — an observation considered and rejected
is not a finding. When both return zero, still state the one-line comparison and
name each reviewer's rejected candidates. This is collected automatically for the
team's tooling comparison — the developer does nothing extra.

**Additionally:** when the diff changes auth/authorization logic, parsing of
untrusted input (a new parser, deserializer, or raw-byte handling — standard
coercion of a route parameter with validation does not count), file uploads, or
secrets handling, run the built-in `security-review` skill on the branch — merely
adding a standard validation rule does not count. Its findings go through the same filter and the same fix loop, within the same
two-cycle budget — security-review does not grant an extra cycle.

## Step 4 — Verification

- **Watch it work, when there is something to watch.** For a change with observable
  behaviour, invoke the built-in `run` skill to bring the project up and confirm the
  change does what the task asked, not only that the tests are green. Skip it for a
  pure refactor, a config change or documentation — and say that you skipped it.
- **Tests always:** run the project's test suite for the touched area; the change is
  not done while tests fail. If the standard way to run tests is unavailable (no
  runtime, no dependencies installed), either run them in an equivalent environment
  that is already available (e.g. a running docker daemon), or put an honest "tests
  not run — no runtime available" into "НЕ проверено" with the exact command for
  the human to run. Docker counts as available only with a running daemon — never
  install or start runtimes and daemons on the developer's machine for this, and
  never imply tests passed when they did not run. An honest "tests not run" does
  not block Steps 5–6: it goes first in "НЕ проверено" and the work proceeds to
  commit and handover.
- **Live stand — only if the developer said yes at intake:** follow the project's
  `.claude/verify.md` (stand address, test user, how to seed data). Verify with real
  requests — direct API calls for backend, Playwright for UI — against real data.
  Keep the evidence: the exact requests/steps and the responses, for the handover.
  You may fill and update `.claude/verify.md` yourself as you go: something you
  create during verification (a test user, seeded data) or discover (a working URL,
  an auth recipe) goes into the file — and every such change is listed explicitly
  in the handover.

## Step 5 — Commit

Commit yourself, by the convention in
[commit-convention.md](references/commit-convention.md) — or by whatever Step 1
found for the `commit` topic, which wins over it. One logical change
per commit, messages in English, `Refs:` line with the ClickUp task URL, never a
`Co-Authored-By` line. Task-prep files (prepared context, developer notes) are never
committed — they describe the work, not the product, and in the repo they rot into
misleading documentation; one already tracked before the run is left untouched and
noted in the handover. A `.claude/verify.md` you created at intake is project config, not task
prep: commit it as its own `chore` commit placed before the task's commits, keeping
the task's `Refs:` line (the task is what brought the file into being). The MR
is not yours: leave a clean committed branch and stop there — pushing and creating
the MR belong to a separate tool.

## Step 6 — Handover report

The final message to the developer. This is what "then the human looks" runs on, so
it is short, honest and complete:

```
## Требует решения разработчика
[optional first section — only when stop rule 1 escalations exist: contradictions
between the task statement and the code, and out-of-scope defects the review
surfaced; one numbered point each. Omit the section entirely when there are none]

## Что сделано
[what changed and why this way — a few sentences, not a file list]
[one line with the minimal-code ladder outcome: what was reused, or why new code was needed]
[a tracked task-prep file left untouched is noted here, at the end]

## Проверено
[tests run + result; stand verification: exact requests/steps and what they returned]
[changes you made to .claude/verify.md — anything created or discovered during verification]
[when nothing executed, this section holds only the review results and says so in one line —
never pad it with the appearance of verification]

## НЕ проверено
[what was not verified and why — including "standards unavailable during this run" if it happened,
and "live verification skipped by the developer's choice" when option 3 was chosen at intake]

## Ревью
[which reviewers actually ran — canonical form: "встроенный code-review (уровень N); ocr в прогоне не участвовал" / "+ ocr delegation pass" / "ручной проход по review-checklist.md (за встроенного)"; combine the forms with "+" when cycles or slots used different reviewers]
[findings fixed; findings remaining after 2 cycles, if any]
[when both reviewers ran: built-in N findings / ocr M findings, overlap K, unique-to-one listed in one line each]

## Куда смотреть в первую очередь
[the 1–3 places a human should read with attention]

СТАТУС: ГОТОВО
```

**The last line is the status, and it is not optional.** Exactly one of three, on its
own line, as the final thing in the message:

- `СТАТУС: ГОТОВО` — the work is finished and nothing is waiting on a person.
- `СТАТУС: ЖДУ РЕШЕНИЯ — <what exactly>` — a stop rule fired, or intake is unanswered;
  what is written is committed and the report says what the decision is.
- `СТАТУС: БЛОКЕР — <what exactly>` — the run cannot continue for a reason no decision
  fixes: a stand that is down, access that does not exist, a dependency that will not
  build.

It exists because an unattended run is read by something before it is read by someone,
and prose cannot be told apart at a glance: a finished run, a run waiting on an answer
and a run that died all end in a wall of text. The three states are the same three the
team's roles already declare, so a watcher learns one convention rather than two.

The report language follows the developer's language (Russian for the team). The status
line stays in this exact form in every language, because it is read by machines.

## Stop rules — the only mid-flow interruptions

A stop interrupts pushing forward, never preserving results: before any stop, commit
the work that is already written and verified as far as it could be (by Step 5's
convention), so a stopped run never strands green code in a dirty tree. Every stop
still ends with the handover report — the stop reason becomes its first section
(«Требует решения разработчика»), and the run continues through Steps 5–6 with what
it has.

Stop pushing forward and call the developer when:

1. A contradiction between the task statement and the reality of the code or the
   stand blocks the core of the task, or a fix would require changing the statement
   or its scope — that decision is the developer's, not yours. When the
   contradiction touches only part of the task, do not stop at all: implement
   everything that has a real code target and put the contradiction at the top of
   the handover.
2. Two full review cycles are done and findings remain — report them honestly,
   do not loop a third time.
3. `.claude/verify.md` contradicts reality (stand is down, test user is gone, the
   commands it names do not exist) — report exactly what each of its instructions
   returned, and do not improvise credentials or endpoints. Improvising means
   inventing addresses or credentials that exist nowhere in the repo; a run command
   the project's own README documents is a discovery, not an improvisation — offer
   it to the developer as a one-question choice (fix verify.md to match reality, or
   switch this run to tests-only), and never silently verify against a stand the
   config does not describe.
4. Tests keep failing after two focused fix attempts — hand over with the failing
   output. Never reclassify a failure as "tests not run".
